# [Pong](https://github.com/CalvinChe/CS50/blob/master/GameTrack/pong/main.lua)
Implemented an AI-controlled paddle, (player2) such that it will try to deflect the ball at all times.

## Specification
The centre of the player 2 paddle will always try to match the Y value of the centre of the ball
The paddle may only go as fast as a the paddle acceleration speed.
